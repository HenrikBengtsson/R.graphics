Package: R.graphics
===================

Version: 0.44.0 [2013-02-07]
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.15.2 with 1 WARNING.
o Updated package to have a NAMESPACE.
o BUG FIX: Device$setStyle() no longer tries to set graphical 
  parameter 'tmag', because it is now obselete in R.
o BUG FIX: Now Device$get/setPlotParameters() uses the global 
  environment to store the parameters.


Version: 0.43.0 [2010-11-28]
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.12.0.
o Using packageStartupMessage() instead of cat().
o Updated to x.y.z version format.
o Renamed HISTORY to NEWS.
o BUG FIX: set() of Device tried to infer the default width and height
  from the default arguments of the device function.  However, such
  defaults has been moved to options of the grDevices package.


Version: 0.42 [2007-05-09]
o Package now passes R CMD check on R v2.5.0.


Version: 0.41 [2006-09-12]
o Added package 'grDevices' as a package this one depends on.  This
  is required for package without a namespace in the upcoming 
  R v2.4.0 release.


Version: 0.40 [2006-01-21]
o Package passes R CMD check without errors and warnings.
o Added Rdoc comments to all new methods.  


Version: 0.39 [2005-12-05]
o Added static method open() to Device.  The methods open() and print()
  share newly added method getParameter() for calculating device-specific
  parameters.


Version: 0.38 [2005-03-07]
o Added static method findPngDevice() to Device.


Version: 0.37 [2005-02-25]
o Package passes R CMD check without warnings. 
o Moved all BitmapImage classes to the new R.image package.


Version: 0.36 [2005-01-18]
o Added test for Device$print() when calculating relative width, 
  e.g. "100%!", when height=0.
o BUG FIX: From R v2.0.0, Device$print("foo.eps") gave error "invalid
  graphics state". This is now corrected.


Version: 0.35 [2004-10-23]
o getRGBorHSV() in Colors generated "NAs are not allowed in subscripted 
  assignments" error in R v2.0.0. Corrected.


Version: 0.34 [2004-10-21]
o as.RGBImage() of the RGBImage class now have a 'coefs' argument.
  This allows extraction of color modified RGB images.
o Added more help pages with more examples.
o Removed obsolete Legend class.
o Added trial methods getDimensions() and getAspectRatio().
o Device$print("xxx.eps") forgot to print with paper="special".
  This would *not* rescale the background (for instance if forced to 
  "white"), but only the bounding box. This would result in a figure
  that overlapped the text in a LaTeX document.


Version: 0.33 [2004-04-21]
o Added get-, set- and resetOptions(). This will also fix the R v1.9.0
  problem where they've "removed" .PostScript.Options, which I previously
  relied on. 
o BUG FIX: The left and bottom click-outside-margin rules were incorrect
  for plotSymbols(interactive=TRUE) in Device.


Version: 0.32 [2003/12/23]
o Added set- and getPrintPath(), which is used by print(), to the
  Device class. Thus, it is possible to set a default output
  path for Device$print().
o Robustness fix: The 'path' argument had to contain a trailing "/" for
  BitmapImage$read() to work. Fixed.


Version: 0.31 [2003/11/21]
o Rewrote some of the methods in Colors to make use of the new
  Color and ColorFilter classes in the new R.colors package. The
  intension is to phase-out the Colors class.


Version: 0.30 [2003/10/19]
o Added support to read gzip'ed PPM files, e.g. foo.pgm.gz, with
  BitmapImage$read(). This is convenient since PPM does not support 
  compression otherwise.
o Removed obsolete class Legend. Use legend() instead.


Version: 0.29 [2003/07/18]
o Added a Device$choose(), which brings up a window with a list of
  all open figures and by selecting anyone that figure will be activated
  and brought to front.


Version: 0.28 [2003/07/07]
o Removed the obsolete XYZCImage and ColorMap classes.
o Rd BUG FIX: When the new @synopsis tag of Rdoc comments was used the
  \usage{} of eps() contained a '%' which means a comment in Rd format
  resulting in unbalanced curly brackets. Rdoc in R.oo was corrected
  accordingly.


Version: 0.27 [2003/05/04]
o Now setPlotParameters() opens a new window if non is currently open.
  This solves the bugs that the plot examples in com.braju.sma do not
  work anymore.


Version: 0.26 [2003/04/18]
o BUG FIX: Device$print() and Device$set() did not calculate the width
  correclty if it was given as a percentage of the default width, e.g.
  "200%". It became the percentage of the height instead.
o BUG FIX: Device$print() and Device$set() did not accept numerical
  values for width, height and pointsize. If tried, the default value
  would be used instead.


Version: 0.25 [2003/03/10]
o Updated readPPM() for BitmapImage classes to be more memory efficient.
  This is done by reading in the data in blocks and convert block by block
  to integers. Images that were too big to read before, can now be read.
o writePPM() for MonochromeImage was not implemented for ascii=TRUE. Also, 
  the data is written row by row (for ASCII) to save memory. Writing binary
  data block by block is still to come. 
o Created a special version of image() for GrayImage to save memory. The
  generic implementation found in BitmapImage is less memory efficient.
o Added method getColorMap() to BitmapImage to get all colors currently used
  in the BitmapImage. It should be reimplemented in each subclass to safe
  memory. 
o Made the constructor of GrayImage more memory efficient by not doing
  modulo maxValue if it is not necessary. 


Version: 0.24 [2003/02/23]
o Updated set() and print() in the Device class to be more clever about
  different types of values of the height and width arguments.
o Changed a one occurances of class(x) to data.class(x) in class XYZCImage.


Version: 0.23 [2003/01/17]
o Added getMouseClick(), which return the (standardize [0,1]x[0,1] or
  plot) coordinates of one or several mouse click similar to locator(),
  but here the coordinates can also be relative to the window (the figure
  region) and not only to the plot region.
o Added bringToTop(), which basically just call bringToTop(), but got 
  somewhat fancier error messages.


Version: 0.22 [2003/01/10]
o BUG FIX: If the image to be converter was not in the current directory
  the temporary PPM file was given an invalid pathname. Added a simple
  call to basename() to fix this.
o Now read() in BitmapImage checks if a file exists or not before trying
  to read it.
o Now readPPM() accept binary files with maxValue > 255 too. According to
  the file format definitions maxValue should be forced to 255 if the
  file is binary, but for instance ImageMagick's convert converts a 16-bit
  TIFF file to a 16-bit binary PGM file.
o Now getColors() of the GrayImage class support NA values.
o BUG FIX: The internal color map used by image() of class BitmapImage was
  not minimal in size due to a typo.
o BUG FIX: Using numeric values for the width and height arguments of
  Device$print() was broken due to the changes in previous version.
o BUG FIX: BitmapImage$read() was broken when non-builtin 
  file formats were to be read. When trying to call the external image 
  converter an error was generated, because the toUpper() function has 
  been removed. Furthermore, now it is possible to specify the external
  image converter software to be used or a wrapper function that calls 
  an external image converter by setting the the option "imageConverter". 
  See help(read.BitmapImage) for more information.
o Added the static method getRgbFromWavelength() to the Colors class. This
  method transforms wavelengths into (R,G,B) values. Note that this is only
  a subjective mapping and there is no physical true mapping.


Version: 0.21 [2002/12/07]
o Now both argument 'width' and 'height' of Device$print() can be
  specifying a relative (percentage) size at the same time. It is not a
  percentage of the other axis (as it used to be), but the percentage of
  the default size. To specify the relative size to the other axis one
  has to add a "!", e.g. width="100%!", height="50%" to make the height
  50% of the default device size and the width the same as the height. 


Version: 0.21 [2002/11/11]
o Device$plotSymbols() now also has an interactive mode (interactive=TRUE)
  where one can pick character to a list by click on them. The interactive
  mode will only take place if R is run in interactive mode.
o Moved static methods plotSymbols() and setStyle() in the Plots class
  to the Device class. The idea is to phase out the Plots class, because
  the rational for it was basically the same as for the Device class.
o Added static method Device$plotRegions() for clarifying the different
  regions: 1) outer margin region, 2) figure region and 3) plot region.
o Updated the gif() command to 1) not create temporary variables in 
  .GlobalEnv. It now also convert to a tempory gif file and first then
  rename that to the wanted filename. This means that if the filename
  does not have a *.gif extension a gif file will still be generated.
  Finally, the option "imagemagick" contains named field where one of 
  them can be "convert" for specifying the path to the convert command.
  Note that on WinXP Pro there is already a convert command in the path.


Version: 0.20 [2002/10/23]
o Device$print() is now keeping the proportion of the image size if
  only one of the arguments 'width' and 'height' is given.
o Made the package compatible with the new Rx.oo core.


Version: 0.19 [2002/10/09]
o Added toMonochrome() and toGrayScale() to the classes MonochromImage,
  GrayImage and RGBImage.


Version: 0.18 [2002/08/23]
o Static methods getRGB() and getHSV() in Colors now return NA's where 
  its corresponding input values are NA's. Plotting with NA colors does
  in most plotting function plot with a transparent color or with the
  background color.


Version: 0.17 [2002/07/18]
o From the former RGBImage class a hierarchy of image classes has been
  created. The root image class is BitmapImage, which is abstract but has
  static methods. The former RGBImage class and the new GrayImage class 
  inherits from this class. The MonochromeImage class inherits from the
  GrayImage class. All classes have "as"-methods to convert an objects 
  into one of the other image classes.
  Added support to read and write PBM and PGM image files too. Even more
  interesting is that, when reading an unknown image format, ImageMagick's
  convert is called to first convert the image to a temporary PPM file, 
  which is then read by  readPPM(). This means that if one has 'convert' 
  installed you can basically read any image formats. If ImageMagick is
  not installed an "image format is not recognized" error is thrown.


Version: 0.16 [2002/06/28]
o RGBImage: Added support to write (not read) in BMP, EPS, JPG, PNG format.
  Added support to read and write Portable PixMap (PPM) files in both
  ASCII and binary formats. 
  It seems that the bmp() driver is a little bit buggy when there are too
  many colors in the image so don't expect correct BMP files in all cases. 
  Why, is still to be investigated.
  Added method image() to the RGBImage class 
  which makes use of image.matrix() in R.base. image() is much better than
  plot(), which tends to add space between pixels.
o BUG FIX: When R CMD check is runned .PlotParameters is not correctly
  created. Added a workaround in set-/getPlotParameter().


Version: 0.15 [2002/05/31]
o Added static methods rgbToColors(), invert() and getMonochrome() to
  class Colors.


Version: 0.14 [2002/05/26]
o Package now passed R CMD check with 3 warnings (and some "Signal 127"???).
o Now also the XYZCImage constructor accepts functions.
o Minimized the number of warnings when loading packages.


Version: 0.13 [2002/05/07]
o BUG FIX: getHeatColors(), getTopoColors(), getTerrainColors(),
  getCyanMagentaColors() and getRainbowColors() always returned the last
  value as NA. This was due to an internal out-of-range array index.
o Added getRed(), getGreen() and getBlue() to class Colors for simplicity.


Version: 0.12 [2002/04/21]
o BUG FIX: Internal bug fix in static method getGray() in class Colors.


Version: 0.11 [2002/04/07]
o Updated plotSymbols() in Plots to produce nicer numbering on the axis.
  In combination with the new intToOct() function in R.base it is easy
  identify the wanted octal code, e.g. 252 -> "\374".


Version: 0.10 [2002/04/03]
o Added support for (R.io) File object filename specifications for the
  Device and RGBImage I/O methods, e.g. Device$print().
o Added colorToRGB(), getHeatColors(), getTopoColors(), getTerrainColors(),
  getCyanMagentaColors(), and getRainbowColors() to class Colors. All the
  color generator methods now return an object colors with the same 
  dimension as the (first) input argument.


Version: 0.9 [2002/03/30]
o Made the package a little bit less depending on package R.io.
o BUG FIX: Made class XYZCImage work with Rdoc$buildClass().


Version: 0.8 [2002/03/13]
o Added from.data.frame() to class XYZCImage. Also, take a look at that
  help file, because it demonstrates how one can estimate thin-plate
  splines using the package gss. The example code generates some nice
  2d and 3d plots.


Version: 0.7 [2002/01/24]
o Added putAuthor(), putDataset() and putTimestamp() to class Device.
o Updated print.Device() to support widths and heights like width="50%".


Version: 0.6 [2002/01/18]
o subplots() is now by default calling subplots.Plots().
o If a vector/matrix is given to subplots, the *length* of it
  will be used as the wanted number of subplots.


Version: 0.5 [2002/01/13]
o Added subplots.Plots for more easily generated subplots. 


Version: 0.4 [2001/09/20]


Version: 0.3 [2001/07/24]


Version: 0.2 [2001/05/06]


Version: 0.1 [2001/05/04]
o First version.
